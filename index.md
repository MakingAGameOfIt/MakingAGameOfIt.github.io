**Update**:
*Given the current situation with COVID-19, the* Making a Game of It *workshop will take place remotely this summer.
Read about our plans for classroom format, tech logistics, and participant security [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/remote-workshop).*

By the end of camp, you will be able to develop software in Python, one of the most popular programming languages, and design and implement a video game that you can play with friends, as well.
Students in this summer camp will be well prepared to enter Computer Science majors at MSU and other universities.
The class is taught by Computer Science and Engineering faculty and graduate students trained in teaching interested students to program for the first time to ensure a top-notch experience.
